# MuchtallWindowArranger
AHK script to automatically resize and rearrange saved window positons (see https://www.muchtall.com/2013/04/23/muchtall-window-arranger-save-window-positions-and-size/)

Since version 20200817, you no longer need to specify the number of screens. Instead, the script automatically detects the current screen layout, and generates separate profiles for them.
